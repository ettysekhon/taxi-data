# Connect Kestra to GCP

## GCP Account & Project Setup

If you already have a GCP account and project skip ahead. If not, here's what you need:

1. Go to <https://console.cloud.google.com/>
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new project (e.g., "kestra-demo")

> [!NOTE]
> You need to provide a payment method in this step.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be aware that queries against GCP can incur costs. Check twice before running queries.

### Install GCP CLI MAC

If you have the GCP CLI already installed, you can skip this command.

On Mac:

```bash
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

gcloud init
```

During `gcloud init`, it will:

- Ask you to log in with your Google account
- Ask you to select or create a project (use the actual name of the project - in our case 'kestra-demo').

### Install GCP CLI WSL2

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" \
  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list

curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg > /dev/null

sudo apt update && sudo apt install google-cloud-sdk


### Enable required APIs

For this tutorial, we will use Google Storage and BigQuery. Therefore, we need to enable their APIs.

```bash
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com

gcloud services enable bigquery.googleapis.com
```

### Create a GCS Bucket

> [!NOTE]
> Replace 'com-mycompany-kestra-demo' with something unique (bucket names are global).

```bash
gsutil mb -l europe-west2 gs://com-mycompany-kestra-demo/
```

Verify if it was created, via:

```bash
gsutil ls
```

> [!NOTE]
> Bucket names must be globally unique across all of GCP, so a reverse domain identifier with dashes combined with the project name makes sense (e.g. `gs://com-mycompany-kestra-demo`).

### Create a BigQuery Dataset (for testing)

For testing, we'll need a dataset. Run these commands to create and verify them:

```bash
bq mk --dataset --location=europe-west2 kestra_test

bq ls
```

The second command should print out the file.

### Create a service account

A service account is like a robot user or machine identity in GCP. It's used when applications (like Kestra) need to access GCP resources automatically, without a human logging in.

These are the required commands you need to run.

- Create the service account

  ```bash
  gcloud iam service-accounts create kestra-sa --display-name="Kestra Service Account"
  ```

- Get and store your project ID

  ```bash
  PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
  ```

- Grant it permissions for BigQuery

  ```bash
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:kestra-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/bigquery.admin"
  ```

- Grant it necessary permissions for Cloud Storage

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:kestra-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/storage.admin"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, these permissions are too broad. Consider not using the `bigquery.admin` and `storage.admin` role.

### Generate and Download the JSON Key

These keys are now needed to perform uploads for the service account.

Run these commands:

- Create and download the key

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/kestra-gcp-key.json --iam-account=kestra-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

- Verify the file exists

```bash
ls -lh ~/kestra-gcp-key.json
```

### Create secret for Kestra deployment

[Link to kestra how to page](https://kestra.io/docs/how-to-guides/google-credentials)

```bash
echo SECRET_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(cat kestra-gcp-key.json | base64 -w 0) >> .env_encoded
```

### Use docker-compose.yml to start up Kestra

## Start Kestra

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

### Create Your First Flow

Use the flow I specified here: [Link to the flow 1_3](https://github.com/andkret/kestra-demo/blob/3383d8804ca5ffc1cdd3df5a40fda2c68c1aa60d/dev.testing/flows/1_3/1_3-test-gcs-connection.yaml)

## Check file content

After a successful run, use the following command (again replace with YOUR actual bucket name):

```bash
gsutil cat gs://com-mycompany-kestra-demo/test/hello.txt
```

This should output:
`Hello from Kestra! GCP connection works! 🎉`
